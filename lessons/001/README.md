In this lesson we're building a simple TypeScript application running in a Fastify HTTP server that, upon accessed through a browser, it will make a request to a Mock API endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1. The response from the Mocked API endpoint will be processed by TypeScript Type System, transformed and returned to the browser.
